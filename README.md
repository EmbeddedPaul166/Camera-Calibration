# Camera-Calibration

### Overview
Camera calibration app written in python3 for mono and stereo systems. It uses standard chessboard for calibration. To change parameters such as square size, width and height, edit mono_calib.py for single camera, and stereo_calib.py for stereo cameras.
### Mono camera calibration
To save snapshots run save_snapshots.py and hit space bar to take a picture.
To calibrate run mono_calib.py. It will calibrate using all images previously generated by save_snapshots.py and store results in .npz file.
### Stereo camera calibration
To save snapshots run save_stereo_snapshots.py and hit space bar to take picture pairs.
To calibrate run stereo_calib.py. It will calibrate using all image pairs previously generated by save_stereo_snapshots.py and store results in .npz files. Stereo calibration first calibrates each camera individually and then proceeds to calibrate stereo and after that, rectify stereo. On default it uses CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS, CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC and CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH (for camera pairs with identical focal length). To change this edit "flags" variable in stereo_calib.py.
